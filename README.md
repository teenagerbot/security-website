# security-website
This library will help protect your site from embedding on other people's sites

This library is designed to protect your site from embedding on other people's sites, that is, other programmers will not be able to embed your site on their own through `<iframe>`

# How to use

We connect the file (You should connect the script tag ONLY in the head):
```html
<script src="https://blocking.teleweb.repl.co/secure.min.js" link-block="block.html" secure is-file></script>
```

Where:\
`link-block` - file that will be displayed when your site is blocked\
`is-file` - checks if the file you linked in the attribute exists *link-block*\
`secure` - enables blocking, if you do not register it, then it does not block in the iframe

*If it exists, it reproduces it in an iframe, otherwise it displays its default version of the page*

File `block.html` does not exist, so the program issued its own version of the inscription\
Looking at your browser language, the program displays text in your language

**üî¥Attentionüî¥**\
*Never make your site in the editor codepen.io - protection does not work (apparently the editor itself removes the restrictions)*\

# Example

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css">
    <script src="https://blocking.teleweb.repl.co/secure.min.js" link-block="block.html" secure is-file></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>hello I'm website</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now let's imagine that another programmer has received your site's link and is trying to embed your site for himself:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>example hacker</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="exampleHacker.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <iframe src="https://link..../hi.html" width="90%" height="50%"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```
